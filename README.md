# Guess-the-Word-Hangman-Game-in-Python
This is a simple Hangman game written in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a list of pre-defined words, and the player has to guess the letters in the word before running out of attempts.

The game has a basic text-based user interface, and uses the built-in input function to allow the player to guess letters. The game keeps track of the letters guessed, the correct guesses, and the remaining attempts.

To play the game, simply run the main.py file in your Python interpreter. The game will start and prompt you to guess a letter. Enter a letter and hit enter to see if it's in the word.

This Hangman game is a fun way to practice your Python programming skills, and can be easily customized to add your own words or features.
